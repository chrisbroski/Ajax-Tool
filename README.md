Ajax Tool
=========

I created this single page of HTML/CSS/JavaScript as a utility to quickly work with same-domain REST web services using common HTTP verbs and easily adding custom HTTP request headers and enitity body.

It can accept parameters in the query string. The "Save" button converts the UI into a sharable URL.

Because most Ajax is not cross-domain, save a copy of the HTML page to the server it is meant to work with before using.
